## Ближайшая цель

[Prepare Flare for safe parallel development and then implement scalable imports, Project Memory improvements, and acquisition attribution through separately claimed tasks.](NOW.md)

Критерий готовности: Coordination is ready when root AGENTS.md leads a fresh agent to AGENT_SETUP.md, task-sync v0.1.0 reads the published shared state, render-status and verify-snapshot pass, doctor succeeds, and the branch, scope, overlap, and acceptance rules are documented. Product work requires separate task-specific acceptance and evidence.

## Ближайшие шаги (не более пяти)

1. `WEB-002` (на проверке) — Add a Subscription section to Settings with Free, Pro and Team descriptions; grey Current for the current Free tier and blue Buy actions. Connect Pro Buy to official Paddle.js Sandbox overlay using public env placeholders and price pri_01m3y1nvmgw2avt60bz87161c2, quantity 1, authenticated email and customData.userId. Enforce sandbox-only tokens, single initialization and checkout locking, localized recoverable errors, existing design/auth preservation and frontend checks. Team stays explicitly unconfigured until a separate Sandbox price exists. No Live, server API key, webhooks, entitlement/DB changes, portal, cancellation or deployment.. Условие: Owner requested merge and deployment on 2026-10-02. PR32 merged and deployed to https://flare4u.tech/settings; Paddle remains Sandbox. Actual signed-in checkout/trial/payment verification is pending a Flare session; no paid access or plan DB changes.
2. `OPS-001` (на проверке) — Resolve production staging service/upload path, API-worker storage reachability, worker isolation/resources, storage identity/network/CORS, physical ZIP deletion/retention and monitoring/load-test environment. Publish dated redacted operator decisions/evidence; no provisioning. Contract: docs/ONBOARDING_MEMORY_ATTRIBUTION_DECISIONS.md#ops-001.. Условие: Review redacted runtime/staging decision and evidence record; Vova selection/acceptance and sanitized inventory remain pending. Do not mark done or authorize rollout from public probes.
3. `API-001` (будем брать) — Implement Paddle Sandbox signed webhooks, durable ordered/deduplicated subscription state and authoritative workspace-wide Pro entitlement during trialing/active subscriptions. Add authenticated server-bound checkout intents, tenant-safe persistence, truthful Subscription status refresh and backend/frontend regression/security tests. Preserve auth, design, daily Analyze limits and Sandbox-only checkout. No Live, cancellation portal, new premium quota policy, production secret access or deployment.. Условие: Assigned by human reply on 2026-10-03: create API-001 and coordinate overlaps; Pro applies to entire workspace. Fresh board confirms GROWTH-002 accepted/merged/done, schema0020 available, no active overlapping task. Start from current main; use next0021 migration, owner-only checkout intent and immutable workspace binding. Prepare reviewed PR with env placeholders and activation guide.; зависит от: GROWTH-002

- `ARCH-002` (требуется информация) — Future Project Memory implementation after budget approval: layered section/document characteristics, lexical-first retrieval, explicit counterevidence/completion lane, original evidence grounding and lifecycle/evaluation.
